# May 21 Morning : Got the screen to work!

First checked out some youtube videos abt the working and schematics of an mechanical keyboard, Found about QMK firmware started listing out the components required
(i had experience with easyeda) so started working on the schematics

Almost done with the schematics according to qmk website( good news - found out about c type arduino pro micro)

Should I start working on PCB????? (im excited) yes lesgoo

I want a modular just plain keyboard with no extra design( strictly no RGB)

lesgoo pcb came out as i wanted it to bee

we will be designing case in the next session

## May 22 : Done with the 3d case
i wanted a sleek design with miniilist options so i designed my own case for it( its in the repo)

## June 7, 2025

Today I spent time researching different parts for the MechaKey K48 build to bring down the cost and make sure everything is easily available. I checked prices on Robu, AliExpress, and JLCPCB, and updated the BOM accordingly with better links and totals. Also made sure that the new parts I picked still work properly with the current PCB layout—didn’t want to take any chances there. Overall, just tried to make the build smoother and less headache when ordering
maybe after building it will thunk whether to print the case or make my own using arcylic sheets
